# USD-TRY-Exchange-prediction-ARIMA-MODEL

##Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the USD/TRY (US Dollar – Turkish Lira) exchange rate using historical financial data from 2020 to 2025.
The goal of the project is to:

*Understand trends and patterns in the USD/TRY exchange rate
*Visualize historical price movements
*Build a time series forecasting model to predict future exchange rates

##Libraries
*Pandas
*Numpy
*Matplotlib.pyplot
*Statmodels
*yfinance

##Data Source

Historical exchange rate data is retrieved using yfinance, which provides financial market data directly from Yahoo Finance.

*Ticker symbol used: USDTRY=X
*Time period: 2020 – 2025
*Frequency: Monthly prices

##Results
The model successfully captures overall trends in the USD/TRY exchange rate.
Predictions reflect long-term movements rather than short-term market shocks.
Visual comparison between actual values and predicted values helps evaluate model performance.
